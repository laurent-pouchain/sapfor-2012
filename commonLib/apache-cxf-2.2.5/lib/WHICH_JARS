This directory includes the CXF jar, the CXF manifest jar, the required
dependencies, and many optional dependencies. The "modules" directory
contains the cxf.jar split up into smaller pieces if you wish to use only
specific parts of CXF.

Jars marked with a [6] at the end are optional for Java 6 (update 4 or 
later is supported) as the functionality provided by those jars are 
provided in the JDK.

Some users may prefer to use axis2-saaj.jar rather than saaj-impl.jar. Both are
supported.

The following jars are required for all CXF usage:
- cxf.jar
- commons-logging.jar
- geronimo-activation.jar (Or the Sun equivalent) [6]
- geronimo-annotation.jar (Or the Sun equivalent) [6]
- geronimo-javamail.jar (Or the Sun equivalent) [6]
  (MAY be able to remove javamail if you don't use any MTOM/SAAJ type things)
- geronimo-stax-api.jar (Or the Sun equivalent) [6]
- neethi.jar
- jaxb-api.jar  [6]
- jaxb-impl.jar (this is a [6] for normal runtime, but is required for 
                 tooling and the dynamic clients)
- XmlSchema.jar
- wstx-asl.jar  [6] or another StAX implementation
